## Collecting data

Want to start sending GDPR requests? Nice! Please
document your findings here so that we can add it to
our list of pages. First check
[here](https://github.com/howtogdpr/howtogdpr.me/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3Agdpr+)
if the site isn't already covered. If it isn't,
create a new Issue on GitHub with [this
link](https://github.com/howtogdpr/howtogdpr.me/issues/new?template=add-new-site.md)
and fill out the form.

Why GitHub? We wanted to start fast. In the future
we might change this to a nice and easy form where
you can enter all your data without using a third
party service.

If you want to help as developer or designer, please
open the [GitHub Readme](https://github.com/howtogdpr/howtogdpr.me)
