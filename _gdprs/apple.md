# How can I request all information stored about me?

Go to your [Apple ID account
page](https://appleid.apple.com/#!&page=signin) , scroll down to **Data and
Privacy**, click on **Manage your Data and Privacy** and on the resulting
page click on **Get a copy of your data**. There you can select what data
you are interested in.

The system will send you an email when it is done generating the files for you.

# What data do I get? And in what format?

After a couple of days you will get a link via email to a download
page. On that page I could download 11 zip files containing the
data of a service offered by Apple.

These are the zip files I got:

<ul>
  <li>&#128193; Other data</li>
  <li>&#128193; App Store, iTunes Store, iBooks Store, Apple Music</li>
  <li>&#128193; Apple Online and Retail Stores</li>
  <li>&#128193; Apple-ID-Account- and device information</li>
  <li>&#128193; AppleCare</li>
  <li>&#128193; Game Center</li>
  <li>&#128193; iCloud Bookmarks</li>
  <li>&#128193; iCloud Calendars and Reminders</li>
  <li>&#128193; iCloud Contacts</li>
  <li>&#128193; iCloud Notes</li>
  <li>&#128193; marketing-communications</li>
</ul>

In most folders I found CSV files with my data, in some cases they used more
specific file formats. PDFs for receipts, VCF for my contacts, ICS for my calendars
and so on.

# How can I delete all information stored about me?

Go to [the Apple privacy page](https://privacy.apple.com/) and click on **Delete my account**.
