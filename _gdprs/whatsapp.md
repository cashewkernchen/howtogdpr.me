# How can I request all information stored about me?

Open the app and navigate to **Settings -> Account -> Request Account Info**. There
you can request a data export.

# What data do I get? And in what format?

You will get a zip file with two files. A **json** and a **html** file. 
Both contain the same information.

![html in the zip file](/images/sites/whatsapp/export.png)

It does not contain the messages, but all other data. For example your
contacts and profile picture. Hopefully because they are encrypted and the
service can't deliver them.

# How can I delete all information stored about me?

Open the app and navigate to **Settings -> Account -> Delete my Account**
