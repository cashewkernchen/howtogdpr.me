# How can I request all information stored about me?

Open the app and navigate to **Settings -> Account -> Request Account Info**. There
you can request a data export.

# What data do I get? And in what format?

Not known yet. But looking at the [FAQ](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/26000110?lg=en&lc=DE&eea=1)
it will not contain the messages. Hopefully because they are encrypted and the service can't deliver them.
If you got your data, add a comment in [this issue](https://github.com/howtogdpr/howtogdpr.me/issues/12).

# How can I delete all information stored about me?

Open the app and navigate to **Settings -> Account -> Delete my Account**
