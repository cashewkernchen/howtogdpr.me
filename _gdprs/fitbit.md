# How can I request all information stored about me?

The export dialog offered by Fitbit does not contain all data, it's
resolution is way less than what Fitbit stores internally.

If you want to get *all data*, you need to send an email to
[data-protection-office@fitbit.com](mailto:data-protection-office@fitbit.com)
and demand an data export.

They will send you an email asking you to reply to it to confirm
that you are the owner of that account. After that you will get
a link to **Dropbox** with a folder with all your data in it.
Going this route apparently means that you will share all your
health tracking data with them, too.

# What data do I get? And in what format?

You will get a link to a dropbox folder containing these files:

<ul>
  <li>&#128196; external_user_info_NAME.xls</li>
  <li>&#128196; user_NAME_altitude_data.tsv</li>
  <li>&#128196; user_NAME_distance_data.tsv</li>
  <li>&#128196; user_NAME_gps_data.tsv</li>
  <li>&#128196; user_NAME_heartrate_data.tsv</li>
  <li>&#128196; user_NAME_mets_data.tsv</li>
  <li>&#128196; user_NAME_steps_data.tsv</li>
</ul>

Additionally you will receive an email explaining the data format.
The files are **JSON** files. And as said earlier, these files
contain a higher resolution for all your data. Higher than
you get through the official export functionality.

# How can I delete all information stored about me?

* Go to the [Settings page](https://www.fitbit.com/settings/profile)
* Click on **Delete Account**
* After 7 days your data will be deleted.
